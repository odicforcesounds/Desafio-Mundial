    <p>Concepts on how to evaluate actions</p>

  <article class="content">
    <p>
    We are tools for assessing actions taken by third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
    It's easy to find common perspectives when assessments are entirely focused on what is observable. The greater the number of people who confirm an action, the higher the likelihood that the action was successful.
    </p>
    <p>
    When one person confirms the 'truth,' it tends to be ambiguous. When two people confirm the 'truth,' it becomes plausible. When several unrelated people confirm having seen the same 'truth,' it would be erroneous to doubt its authenticity.
    </p>
    <p>
    If it is indeed a falsehood, it is refuted. Additionally, if it is something that goes against the principles of the challenge, we can (R)eport the action.
    </p>
    <p>
    The assessment options can only be active at the end of a video produced by another user.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this challenge, we consider that 7 consecutive views from random individuals who mark the video they watched as Positive (+) results in approval, earning one point for the user who produced the video.
    </p>
    <p>
    Similarly, 7 consecutive views (in a row) from 7 people who mark the video they just watched as Negative (-) result in the user who produced it receiving 0 (Zero) points.
    </p>
    <p>
    When the same occurs with 7 consecutive markings of the R (Report) option, the video will be directed to an area called the 'Black Box.'
    </p>
    <p>
    The Black Box is a process of evaluation and exposure for educational purposes, where videos will be reviewed by the internal team, and there may be other consequences in the case of abuse.
