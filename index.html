        🌱 Discover Social Tool Kit (STK): A New Way to See Yourself Through the Eyes of Others
      </h2>
      <p><b>Social Tool Kit (STK)</b> is an Android application designed for everyone aged 13 and above who wants to understand how their actions shape the way others see them. Built around three essential “Paths”, STK helps you explore how your choices, behaviors, and personal qualities impact the world—humans, animals, and nature included.
        These three Paths represent universal values that anyone can practice. They’re not about competition or judgment—they’re about growing into someone who cares, contributes, and makes a difference.</p>
     <h2 class="center">
      🎥 Show Your Actions. Inspire Others. Grow Your Profile.
     </h2>
     <p>To keep STK simple and accessible, all you need is a Google account. Because every Google account includes YouTube access, you can easily record and upload videos that demonstrate your positive actions. You decide whether your videos are Unlisted (private within STK) or Public (visible to everyone).

<li>Each personal action video is reviewed by 7 randomly selected users:</li>

<li>Approvals require no comment</li>

<li>Denials require a constructive explanation</li>

<p>Once the voting ends, you earn 1 point in the corresponding Path. There’s no limit—grow your profile as much as you want. Your Path points blend into RGB color channels, creating a unique color identity that reflects your journey.</p></p>      
<h2 class="center">
  🤝 Some Actions Need a Team — That’s Where Groups Shine
</h2>
<p>Not everything can be done alone. STK recognizes that some challenges require 10, 20, or even more people working together.

That’s why STK allows Group Registration.

Groups can:

Solve challenges recorded by individual users,

Earn points based on how many people view the challenge,

Appear on the main page as examples of community strength.

If a challenge receives 300 views, your group earns 300 points. It’s a healthy, meaningful competition where the goal is simple: care for all living beings.

To register a group, you’ll need a domain with email service—something affordable and accessible to anyone.</p>
<h2 class="center">
  🔍 See How Others See You — Instantly
</h2>
<p>Every user has a personal QR code. Scan someone’s code to rate their qualities—positively or negatively—based on real-life interactions.

You can:

Give up to 3 qualities per scan.

Add 1 point per quality.

Choose from different social contexts defined in the app.

It’s a simple, honest way to understand how your behavior affects the people around you.</p>
<h2 class="center">
  🌍 Share STK. Grow the Movement. Improve Yourself.
</h2>
<p>Talk about STK at school, at work, at your favorite café, at church, with friends, with family—anywhere people care about becoming better versions of themselves.

STK helps you discover:

What qualities others admire in you.

What qualities you might want to improve.

How your actions contribute to a healthier, kinder society.

If you’re curious about how others perceive you—or if you want to challenge yourself to grow—STK is the platform for you.
