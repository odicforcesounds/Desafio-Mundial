      <p>This application is in the last stages of the first release, that needs to be approved by Google. After that, we can start playing. The application is a bit different from what I try to imagine as possible, but I am not rich and I could not maintain the dream. So what I made is something similar to what is described, but giving to the user, a bit more work. Is not the perfect solution, but is possible with very low resources. The release will be exposed on Github and the source is and will be, Open Source. Motivating others to participate in this application development, giving extra features that doesn't exist in this version. After this experimental test, I would like to find someone that help me on this project, to implement a blockchain. Yes, the first version will not have a BlockChain. So, all the value that are on You, will be just "numbers" that can be useful to understand your performance in different contexts of life, but without any economic value associated.</p>
      <p>You can check a <b>Static Sample</b> of this competition <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/login/index.html">here</a>. This static page, will be update it with the official release, when everything is ready. So be ready and tell your children about it, your friends, your company, your favorite groups, without exception. This application aims to be used by Children, but we all have a <b>Child</b> inside.</p>
