      <p>Social Tool Kit is a Android application that allow you to show others your actions, based on the 3 main "Paths" / objectives. Designed to be used by children 13 years old and above, STK try to show users, how other users see them. What actions they approved, what choices they like or dislike, what personal qualities are best, in different contexts of life in society. The 3 main objectives that anyone should cultivate and practice, are actions that focus caring other living beings, including humans, animals and nature. Without any kind of discrimination inside each objective, called inside this application as "Paths". </p>
      <p>STK is not the perfect solution and since the author could not maintain the dream as described above, changes were made to make the application intention possible. To use STK Application you need a Google account. Since any user with a Google account have a YouTube account associated, users can perform video demonstrating actions and add them into this application as single personal video-actions or video-challenges that can be solved by groups. Each video can be shared on YouTube as "Unlisted" if the user desire to make that video private or "public" if the user have no concerns about users video. Personal action videos will ask 7 random persons to approve or deny the action. Votes that approve don't need to comment the video and all denials ask users to comment as a mandatory step. Users cannot comment on others comment and all users can edit their own comments. After final results, the author of the video gets 1 point to the <b>Path</b> on users profile. From 0 actions to infinity, there are no limits of how many actions each user can do on each Path. There are 3 Paths and 3 RGB Channels. Those are the color of your profile, a mix of values assciated to the number of actions that you made and others approve. </p>
      <p>Users alone cannot do everything and STK have a opportunity for Groups to show their activity on this 3 main objectives of Life in Communities. This application assumes that single users cannot perform some actions that need more than 1 or 2 persons, but 10, 20 or more. <b>Groups registration is possible</b> and groups can solve challenges that some user did record. Challenges pass through a validation process like single video-actions are, but at final results they are exposed to everyone. For each view the challenge grows 1 point. If one challenge is viewed by 300 users, solving this challenge will give 300 points to the group. After solving a challenge the group is shown in the <a href="https://stk.odicforcesounds.com">main page of this application</a>. Click and Explore by yourself. Groups become part of this Healthy competition, where the main objective is to care other living beings. Please be sure your group have the necessary resources to register. Having a domain and website with mail included, is something that anyone can have almost for free, so this platform assume your group owns a domain with mail services.</p>
      <p>In addition, all users can identify others users by scanning a QR code that all users have to identify themselfs. This feature, allow users to rate others with positive or negative points (max 1 per quality and max 3 qualities per rate-scan) on different contexts defined on this application Interface.</p>
      <p>Talk about STK in your school, in your job, in your favorite coffee, your churche, you friends, your famility and register for better understanding of how others see you. What personal qualities you have that are good, what are the ones that are bad and improve yourself in what you wish to. </p>
