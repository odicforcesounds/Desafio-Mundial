The World Wide Brands Challenge is a unique initiative that encourages employees from companies worldwide to engage in activities that benefit third parties. Participants earn points in the form of coins for each beneficial action they complete. These coins represent tangible efforts to support Human Rights, Animal Rights, and Nature Rights.

This challenge not only recognizes individual contributions but also highlights the collective impact of organizations committed to justice and positive change.
